# VisualizationFramework
A complete rework of one of my old projects. This project is a framework for 3D visualization created with OpenGL.
As opposed to the original version of this project, this one will be created with professional standards in mind. The original project had a class diagram, code documentation created with DoxyGen, design documents and good coding practices. This version will also include unit tests and overall improved code quality.

The 3D visualization framework is designed to be used with Linux.
